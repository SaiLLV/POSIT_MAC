# Efficient MAC Design and implementation on FPGA for Edge AI Applications
Implemented the Posit based MAC unit using Verilog HDL for 8, 16 & 32-bit separately and also checked the results using SOFTPOSIT Python library. Still continuing the research study to design multiprecision MAC which can support 8-bit, 16-bit & 32-bit using SIMD architecture.
